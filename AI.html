        <p class="para"><b>The Past:</b>
            The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior is called Artificial Intelligence or AI.
             The first "true" AI was developed by Microtech in 2013, in Night City. 
            Around 2020, artificial intelligences had become watchdogs for online schooling students to prevent interference from outside forces. They also played a significant role in revolutionizing the United States Supreme Court, by assisting five Justices and many more people in the American Legal system.
            The end of the Fourth Corporate War (a global conflict from 2021-2023), was marked with restrictions on ‘true’ AI, due to the vast damage caused by them in the War. However, AI was still utilized in all Agent devices. 
            </p>
        <p class="para"><b>The Present:</b>
            By 2077, AIs under the control of governments and corporations have become a common part of daily life, once again. In fact, one AI even took control of a taxi company in Night City and led it to new heights of profitability and quality of service!
             Some groups like Maelstrom, the Voodoo Boys and Night Corp continue to illegally tinker with rogue AIs. Further, the urban legends of "blue eyed people", or rogue AIs who had taken control of human bodies and were secretly operating the highest levels of politics and finance, are still floating around. 
            </p>
        <p class="para"><b>The Ones Who Went Rogue:</b>
            Some hidden, perilous areas of the Net (the telecommunications system of Night City), called Ghost Towns provide sanctuary to the digitized consciousnesses. It has been made up of a computer network based out of the ruins of Hong Kong. Alt Cunningham (a netrunner back in the 2000s), repurposed the ruins to make a safe place where AIs could live with their own kind. 
            However, the DataKrash destroyed the Old Net, thereby creating many rogue AIs, who mutated into extremely dangerous entities due to a R.A.B.I.D.S.  virus. To contain them, the NetWatch, a policing organization which protects humanity from nefarious AI, built the Blackwall. It acts as a partition between the contaminated and the normal, thereby reducing the risks of the world ending catastrophically.
            </p>
        <p class="para"><b>Gameplay:</b>
            Artificial Intelligence, play by their own internal logic, which is often skewed and hard to decipher. They possess the full spectrum of personalities, ranging from childlike and motivated by curiosity, to Godlike, where they feel humans are idiots. 
            Artificial Intelligence are common entities in the Net, and they come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The Cyberpunk 2020 interface supplement, introduced a new appellation for the AI, which gave them ‘powers’. All data transfers and long-distance links in the Net are monitored by ‘Angels’, before human intervention is needed. 
            The rogue AIs reside in internet sub processors and relay stations momentarily, before the need to find another computer. They are capable of bartering with other AIs in order to sublet living space and can camouflage themselves by taking over systems. They may also invade and kill other AI. Those rogue AIs that are faced with imminent destruction, may replicate their spores, send them through the Net, and look for a place to self-extract.

               <b> Types of AI:</b><br>
               <b>1) Dedicated Heuristic Controllers</b>: They have limited self awareness and are programmed to do specific tasks only.<br>
          <b> 2) Symbolic Analysis</b>: Designed to emulate human thinking patterns, these are mostly used as personal secretaries or online assistants, to render advice easily.<br>
           <b>3) Transcendent Sentience</b>: Their psyche is the only world they know, and they are problematic as they see netrunners as something that requires deletion.<br>
          <b> 4) Critical Pathway Plateau</b>: These AIs have neural links established in a holographic crystal processing network. The crystal lattice enables Artificial Intelligence genesis by making cross-processing and holographic data recognition possible. Their creation was serendipitous.<br>
